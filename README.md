# Ring Attractor Network 
## Introduction
This repository holds the Neuromatch Academy 2020 project work of Stefano, Nikitas, Pranjal and Angela for a ring attractor network.
## Scientific Question  
How to construct a biologically plausible, dynamic ring attractor network of firing neurons?
## Background 
The  ring attractor with bump like neural activity has been hypothesised to work as a biologically plausible model for memory. It can be used to model the dynamics of head direction, encoded by E-PG neurons of Ellipsoid Body of Drosophilla melanogoster and other cyclic parameters like colours.
## Methods 
Modelling of LIF neurons with a connectivity matrix of 4-4 topology  to construct a desirable  ring attractor. Subsequently, fix points are added  to the network along with normal white noise to make it more biologically plausible. Several iterations of simulation were run with altering parameters to find optimal parameters that allow the network to sustain its activity and behave in an explainable way. 
## Conclusions 
In conclusion, it was found that for a working model of a ring attractor, fixed points at various positions in the ring network are needed to prevent drifting caused by noise. The dynamics of the network are determined by a variety of parameters such as the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons, number of fixed points and the strength of the noise.
